# !IMPORTANT! Install WinPcap. Not sure why but Kamene cannot function without it.
Small program that utilizes the Kamene module for internet packet data analysis. 
Allows for horizontal, vertical and strobe probing. (At least my best idea of these probing methods).
Pcap file included for testing. Can use any pcap file with packet data.
Program creates database with source ports and destinations and source IPs and destinations.
